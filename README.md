# Welcome to the Aerofit Data Analysis Project! 🚀

## About Aerofit 💪

Aerofit isn't just about selling fitness equipment—it's about promoting a lifestyle! We offer a comprehensive range of fitness products, from premium treadmills and exercise bikes to gym equipment and accessories, designed to meet the fitness needs of everyone. 💥

## The Business Challenge 📊

The AeroFit team has a clear objective: to gain deeper insights into our customers to provide personalized treadmill recommendations for new buyers. This project focuses on two primary goals:

1. **Descriptive Analytics:** Develop detailed customer profiles for each AeroFit treadmill model, supported by informative tables and charts. 📈📊

2. **Probability Analysis:** Construct two-way contingency tables and calculate conditional and marginal probabilities to uncover insights that could influence business strategies. 🤓📉

## The Dataset 📦

We have collected valuable data from customers who purchased AeroFit treadmills over the past three months. The dataset includes key features such as:

* **Product Purchased:** KP281, KP481, or KP781
* **Age:** In years
* **Gender:** Male/Female
* **Education:** Number of years of formal education
* **Marital Status:** Single or partnered
* **Usage:** Weekly treadmill usage frequency
* **Income:** Annual income in dollars
* **Fitness Level:** Self-assessed fitness on a scale from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent)
* **Miles:** Average miles walked/run per week

## Treadmill Product Overview 🏃‍♂️

* **KP281:** An entry-level model priced at $1,500.
* **KP481:** A mid-range option for runners, priced at $1,750.
* **KP781:** A high-end treadmill loaded with features, priced at $2,500.

## Project Goals 🌟

This repository features Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks to guide you through the analysis. Here's what you'll achieve:

* **Dataset Exploration:** Import and analyze the dataset to understand its structure and key characteristics.
* **Outlier Detection:** Use box plots and descriptive statistics to identify outliers.
* **Feature Impact:** Analyze how variables like marital status and age affect treadmill choices.
* **Probability Calculations:** Determine and visualize marginal probabilities.
* **Correlation Analysis:** Examine relationships between variables using heat maps and pair plots.

Through these steps, you'll be able to answer interesting questions like, "What's the likelihood of a male customer purchasing a KP781 treadmill?" and classify users into different segments.
